    <h3>Coach Zakaria (ZR)</h3>
    <p>After the departure of Coach Sele Tege, the Italy Kids found themselves without formal leadership for several months. During this period, the team was guided by their captain, MO11. Thanks to the strong foundation laid earlier, the players continued to demonstrate their passion for football, with each member proudly donning their jerseys. MO11 organized practice sessions and matches, ensuring the team's spirit and form remained intact.</p>
    <p>From 2018 to 2019, Coach Zakaria (known as ZR) stepped in to take charge, bringing a new era of success and inspiration to the Italy Kids. ZR, a former professional footballer with a wealth of experience, transformed the team's approach to training and gameplay. His strategic insights, coupled with his ability to motivate, elevated the team's performance to new heights. Under his leadership, every player not only honed their skills but also developed a deep love and commitment to the game. Training sessions became a priority, with players attending regularly, driven by ZR’s encouragement.</p>
    <p><b>MO11,</b> admired for his exceptional skills and exemplary behavior, continued as the team captain during ZR's tenure. However, the team's growing enthusiasm for football occasionally led to clashes, as players juggled their academic responsibilities and rigorous training schedules. ZR worked tirelessly to strike a balance, emphasizing the importance of both education and football. His dedication ensured that no player neglected their studies while pursuing their passion for the sport.</p>
    <p><strong>Coach ZR's legacy is marked by several remarkable achievements, including:</strong></p>

    <h3>Coach Mpini</h3>
    <p>After the impactful tenure of Coach ZR, Coach Mpini stepped in to guide the Italy Kids from 2010 to 2018. As a seasoned individual with a family of his own, Mpini brought a nurturing and caring approach to his leadership. His wisdom and experience, coupled with his ability to understand the players' needs, made him a valuable mentor to the team. Despite his busy schedule and family responsibilities, Mpini dedicated his free time to the Italy Kids, ensuring the team maintained its passion for football.</p>
    <p>Due to his limited availability, the team was often under the supervision of captains, who handled day-to-day activities and organized matches when Mpini was unavailable. His trust in the captains to lead during his absence fostered a sense of responsibility and teamwork among the players. Under his era, the Italy Kids made a significant transition, moving their home pitch to a smaller field. While the new pitch presented challenges, it also brought opportunities for the players to adapt their strategies and improve their skills in tighter spaces.</p>
    <p>Coach Mpini's era was marked by a balance between discipline and encouragement, enabling the players to thrive both individually and as a team. He instilled values of perseverance and collaboration, which remained ingrained in the team's culture long after his tenure. The Italy Kids continued to grow, both in form and unity, under Mpini's leadership. Although his time with the team was divided, his presence left a lasting impact, setting the stage for further success in the years to come.</p>
    <p>Coach Mpini's legacy is a testament to the power of dedication and adaptability, proving that even with challenges, a leader can make a profound difference in the lives of those they guide.</p>
