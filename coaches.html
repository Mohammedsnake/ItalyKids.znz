    <h3>Coach Sele Tege</h3>
    <p>Sele Tege was the first coach to guide Italy Kids, transforming it from a loosely structured team into a well-organized unit. From 2015 to 2017, he brought order, love, and inspiration to the players, creating schedules for training sessions and providing jerseys for the team. His leadership boosted player skills, experience, and even popularity, as the team took part in various competitions and away games under his direction. Sele Tege was known for his motivational approach, keen understanding of player positions, and unwavering dedication to his players. During his era, <strong>MO Snake</strong> was appointed as the team captain due to his excellent behavior and performance. His favorite players, <a href="players.html#MO11">MO Snake</a> and <a href="players.html#KiduliJR">Kiduli JR</a>, often accompanied him to City Combines games beyond Italy street, showcasing their talents. Sele Tege's legacy lives on as the foundation of Italy Kids' success.</p>

    <h3>Coach Zakaria (ZR)</h3>
    <p>After the departure of Coach Sele Tege, the Italy Kids found themselves without formal leadership for several months. During this period, the team was guided by their captain, MO11. Thanks to the strong foundation laid earlier, the players continued to demonstrate their passion for football, with each member proudly donning their jerseys. MO11 organized practice sessions and matches, ensuring the team's spirit and form remained intact.</p>
    <p>From 2018 to 2019, Coach Zakaria (known as ZR) stepped in to take charge, bringing a new era of success and inspiration to the Italy Kids. ZR, a former professional footballer with a wealth of experience, transformed the team's approach to training and gameplay. His strategic insights, coupled with his ability to motivate, elevated the team's performance to new heights. Under his leadership, every player not only honed their skills but also developed a deep love and commitment to the game. Training sessions became a priority, with players attending regularly, driven by ZR’s encouragement.</p>
    <p>MO11, admired for his exceptional skills and exemplary behavior, continued as the team captain during ZR's tenure. However, the team's growing enthusiasm for football occasionally led to clashes, as players juggled their academic responsibilities and rigorous training schedules. ZR worked tirelessly to strike a balance, emphasizing the importance of both education and football. His dedication ensured that no player neglected their studies while pursuing their passion for the sport.</p>
    <p>Coach ZR's legacy is marked by several remarkable achievements, including:</p>
